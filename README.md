# Twitter Clone

This project was created with the purpose of getting practice with react and functional components.
It just mimics the flow of tweets with random auto-generated tweets, lets you tweet and shows a section of auto-generated news. 
Will probably continue it in the future, but as of now the rest of the options such as messaging, editing you profile, bookmarks, lists and other stuff are not functional.
